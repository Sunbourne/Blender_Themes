#Blender Themes
This a repository that contains all of my Blender UI color schemes.
You are free to download, use and alter them as you wish.

##Flix:
My new favorite theme. Mostly inspired by Cinama4D UI.

##Ulysses:
A dark blue theme. Another favorite of mine!

##Macaw:
A dark with faded blue and orange theme. My new favorite!
