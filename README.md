#Blender Themes
This a repository that contains all of my Blender UI color schemes.
You are free to download, use and alter them as you wish.

##Bluebird:
A dark grey, light desaturated blue theme.

##Flatty Dark:
Nothing special here, a dark version of the flatty light theme shipped with Blender.

##Flix:
My new favorite theme. Mostly inspired by Cinama4D UI.

##Ulysses:
A dark Blue theme. Another favorite of mine!
